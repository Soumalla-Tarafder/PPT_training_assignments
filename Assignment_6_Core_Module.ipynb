        "The bias-variance trade-off refers to the trade-off between model complexity and model performance. Models with high bias have limited capacity to capture complex patterns and tend to underfit the data, while models with high variance are sensitive to noise and tend to overfit the data. Model validation helps strike a balance between bias and variance by assessing the model's performance on both training and validation data.\n",
