

To create a goal setting plan for getting a job, I will follow these steps-->

Identify what I want to achieve and write down My goals in SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound) terms.
Create a list of actions that I need to take to reach my goals and prioritize them.
I will set a timeline and deadlines for each action and goal.
Designate the resources and support that I need to accomplish my goals.
Monitor my progress and review my goals regularly.
