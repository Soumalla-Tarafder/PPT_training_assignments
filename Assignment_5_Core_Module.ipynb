        "\n",

        "Disadvantages:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "3. Curse of Dimensionality: KNN suffers from the curse of dimensionality, where the performance degrades as the number of features increases. As the feature space becomes more sparse in higher dimensions, the distance-based similarity measure becomes less reliable.\n",

Here are some approaches to address the issue of imbalanced datasets in KNN:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Adjusting Class Weights:\n",
        "   - One way to handle imbalanced datasets is by adjusting the weights of the classes during the prediction phase.\n",

By selecting a subset of features that capture the most discriminative information, dimensionality reduction helps focus on the most informative aspects of the data.\n",
